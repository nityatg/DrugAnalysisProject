Drug Analysis: Exploring Patterns and Insights

Overview
"Drug Analysis: Exploring Patterns and Insights" is an end-to-end project journeying from Azure services for data processing to Databricks for modeling, and finally to Power BI for visualization. Leveraging Azure Data Factory and Storage, PySpark, and Pandas, the project encompasses data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and classification modeling to predict drug usage. Visualized insights in Power BI offer actionable health patterns and drug utilization trends.

Project Description
"Drug Analysis: Exploring Patterns and Insights" is a comprehensive data analysis endeavor aimed at uncovering valuable insights into drug utilization patterns and health trends. Leveraging Azure services for end-to-end data processing and analysis, as well as Databricks for advanced analytics, the project utilizes a combination of technologies and methodologies to achieve its objectives.

Data Processing and Analysis Workflow:
Azure Data Factory: Orchestrates data workflows for ingesting raw data into Azure Storage and connecting data processing pipelines.
Databricks: Utilizes PySpark and Pandas for thorough data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for modeling.
Machine Learning: Within Databricks, classification modeling techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods are applied to predict drug usage based on patient attributes.
Spark SQL Analysis: Advanced analysis and querying are performed within Databricks using Spark SQL, enabling insights into data distribution, summary statistics, and trend analysis.
Visualization in Databricks: Utilizes Pandas, Matplotlib, and other visualization libraries for exploratory data analysis and visualization within the Databricks workspace.
Power BI Visualization:
Power BI: Transitioning from Databricks, the project utilizes Power BI to create an interactive Health Insights Dashboard and Drug Utilization and Health Matrix Analysis. This includes:
Blood Pressure Analysis by Average Age: Utilizes line charts to visualize blood pressure trends across different age groups.
Gender Distribution: Presented using pie charts to showcase the distribution of patient gender.
Cholesterol Distribution by Sex: Utilizes histograms to illustrate cholesterol levels among different genders.
Drug Utilization Analysis: Presents drug utilization trends through stacked bar chart
Average Sodium to Potassium Level by Gender: Utilizes matrix visuals to find the average sodium to potassium level for different sexes (male and female).
Age Distribution by Sum of Age Bins: Presented using stacked column charts to visualize the distribution of ages grouped into bins.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Generates KPIs to track important health metrics and performance indicators.
